# HYPRLAND SETUP
These are the config files, scripts and fonts for my hyprland desktop environment on Arch Linux.
## TERMINAL
The terminal emulator used is kitty. Its config file is kitty.conf and uses the nerd font IosevkaTerm
## SHELL
At the moment, I am using bash shell. Its config files are .bash_profile, which is used to launch Hyprland after login on tty and .bashrc, which stores the welcome message with fastfetch, the aliases and prompt.
## IDE
The primary IDE is VSCode, with almost no extensions, just configured in the appearance. Its config file is in the folder 'Code - OSS'
## BROWSER
The main internet browser is Firefox. Its config file is userChrome.css and it's customized to be a minimal browser for a focusing experience
## STATUS BAR
The status bar uses a different font than kitty, BigBlueTerm437. It displays information about the current workspace, the clock and date, the wifi, backlight, sound and battery
## SOUNDS
The system plays a sound when booting, shutting down, opening the terminal and the browser.
## FUTURE UPDATES
Regarding future updates, the planned changes are:
- Start with a minimal configuration on NeoViM
- Transition to Zsh shell to have the git prompt
